## Overview

This repository implements a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) that introduces nonlinear effects via polynomial basis expansion and mitigates the barren plateau phenomenon through unitary matrix parameterization. The code is built with PyTorch for training and Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation.
